After all, it is now a synonym of <code>--es_staging</code>. As mentioned above, these are completed features that have not been considered stable yet. If you want to play safe, especially on production environments, consider removing this runtime flag until it ships by default on V8 and, consequently, on Node.js. If you keep this enabled, you should be prepared for further Node.js upgrades to break your code if V8 changes their semantics to more closely follow the standard.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-find-which-version-of-v8-ships-with-a-particular-version-of-node-js" tabindex="-1">How do I find which version of V8 ships with a particular version of Node.js? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-find-which-version-of-v8-ships-with-a-particular-version-of-node-js" aria-label="Permalink to “How do I find which version of V8 ships with a particular version of Node.js?”">​</a></h2><p>Node.js provides a simple way to list all dependencies and respective versions that ship with a specific binary through the <code>process</code> global object.
