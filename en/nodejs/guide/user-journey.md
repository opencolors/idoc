# User Journey

These diagnostics guides were created by the [Diagnostics Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics) with the objective of providing guidance when diagnosing an issue in a user's application.

The documentation project is organized based on user journey. Those journeys are a coherent set of step-by-step procedures that a user can follow to root-cause their issues.
